// For this challenge you will actually have to watch the video! Then, build the image
// loading functionality that I just showed you on the screen.
// Your tasks:
// Tasks are not super-descriptive this time, so that you can figure out some stuff by
// yourself. Pretend you're working on your own 😉
// PART 1
// 1. Create a function 'createImage' which receives 'imgPath' as an input.
// This function returns a promise which creates a new image (use
// document.createElement('img')) and sets the .src attribute to the
// provided image path
// 2. When the image is done loading, append it to the DOM element with the
// 'images' class, and resolve the promise. The fulfilled value should be the
// image element itself. In case there is an error loading the image (listen for
// the'error' event), reject the promise
// 3. If this part is too tricky for you, just watch the first part of the solution

// PART 2
// 4. Consume the promise using .then and also add an error handler
// 5. After the image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds using the 'wait'
// function we created earlier
// 6. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image (set display CSS
// property to 'none'), and load a second image (Hint: Use the image element
// returned by the 'createImage' promise to hide the current image. You will
// need a global variable for that 😉)
// 7. After the second image has loaded, pause execution for 2 seconds again
// 8. After the 2 seconds have passed, hide the current image
// Test data: Images in the img folder. Test the error handler by passing a wrong
// image path. Set the network speed to “Fast 3G” in the dev tools Network tab,
// otherwise images load too fast

// GOOD LUCK 😀
const body = document.querySelector('body');

const wait = function (seconds) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

const createImg = function (imgPath) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const img = document.createElement('img');
    img.src = imgPath;
    body.appendChild(img);
    img.onload = () => {
      img.classList.add('images');
      resolve(img);
    };
    img.onerror = () => {
      reject(new Error("Can't find the image"));
    };
  });

createImg('img/img-1.jpg');
